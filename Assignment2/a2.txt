Title	 Anagram Solver

Instructions
You have to write a program to solve Anagrams. You are given a dictionary as a plain text file. 
You program should take as input an anagram and identify the corresponding word(s) in the dictionary. 

The implementation should be done using hash tables.
Your program should first insert all the words in the dictionary into one or more hash tables and
then given an anagram search the hash table(s) for the corresponding words.
For this scheme to work it is important that you design a suitable hash function. 
Collision resolution should be done using chaining.
You should also report the total time spent for each anagram.
